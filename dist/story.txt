You can’t fully explain what happened that day.
When you returned later, Your Best Pal.EXE was gone.
A nightmare, you thought.
Yet a faint sense of presence lingers in your home.

You went to sleep.
When you wake up, Your Best Pal.EXE has disappeared.
You searched online but found nothing.
What happned? You'll never know.

NORMAL END

Your Best Pal.EXE has disappeared.
You searched online but found nothing.
What was it? You’ll never know.

THE END

-> accept
You press your hand fully against the screen.  
A warm, electric current rushes through you.  
The room around you dissolves into streams of glowing code.
You feel yourself fading, becoming the next Your Best Pal.EXE.  
A message floats: "To leave, you must bring another friend."

BAD END
